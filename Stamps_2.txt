The decision as to whether stamps donations are to be received in exchange for rewards is not about "control the direction of the region". That is silly suggestion and mirrors the rhetoric seen from the likes of Mare Nostrum. It is about the propriety of our recruitment - which I need to be satisfied about as the constitutional "custodian of the on-site capital region". The on-site region includes recruitment.

When I abdicated as Emperor and in all my statements since, I have always been consistent and abundantly clear about my intention to continue functioning as the custodian of the on-site region and that I have not abrogated any authority in that respect. Any suggestion that I renounced my overall responsibility in this regard is incorrect. The suggestion that I have not been clear about that position is inaccurate and offensive. It is on the constitutional basis established that I abdicated.

My expectation is that members of the Monarchy and Regional Officers should be individuals who understand and respect my responsibilities as Emperor Emeritus and custodian of the on-site region. As it is apparent from your words and actions that you do not currently accept my decision-making authority as custodian of the on-site region, I have removed your authorities for Appearance, Border Control, Embassies and Communications, as well as your authority to recruit. I will review the overall situation and what is most appropriate for the long term in consultation with the Emperor if and when he is next available, unless sooner action is required.
