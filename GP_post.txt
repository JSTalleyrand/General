The attempt to somehow portray these resignations as a foreign-backed conspiracy is entirely laughable but unsurprising nonetheless. I am cognizant of the fact that is convenient to distract from your failures by continuously blaming your enemies for galvanising those who have grown sick and tired of the leadership's antics. I hate to break it to you and ruin your narrative but this is no foreign-backed conspiracy; it is simply the result of the regional leadership losing its legitimacy in the eyes of the most consequential citizens in the region.

I had the (mis)fortune of succeeding Valfor as Prince Imperial. It was still the time I believed, despite having been told by Valfor many of the incidents he describes in his post, that it wasn't (or couldn't) be that bad. And I was repeatedly proven wrong.

[quote="Onderkelkia";p="39487234"]I note the same condescension you have displayed towards Nulkia throughout his tenures as Crown Prince and now Emperor. This was a matter driven by foreign-policy considerations, not military tactics, and the overarching purpose of the Imperial Army is to act as an instrument of the LKE politically.[/quote]

That the man who believes he holds the monopoly of the truth uses the word condescension is insulting. What about the sort of polite condescension against any idea or word or phrase that even dared diverge from your own prejudices? You can now rest easy knowing those "condescending" the perfect, faultless regional leadership are no longer around.

[quote="Onderkelkia";p="39487234"]1. Regarding Valfor's concerns about inactivity on the part of Emperor Theoden and Valfor's predecessor as Crown Prince, this was an area where what happened, at times (particularly during leaves of absence), was less than what was ideal. I provided appropriate counsel to the Emperor on both issues. These matters were addressed in good faith over short-term and long-term timescales in the best interests of the region (e.g. the former Crown Prince changing role; action by the Emperor to ensure he consistently had an effective presence outside leaves of absence; succession planning for the Crown - which you can see today was fulfilled successfully with the succession of Nulkia to the throne at the conclusion of Theoden's accomplished reign).

2. During his tenure as Prince Imperial and later as Crown Prince, Valfor made decisions which it should have been appreciated would have been better left to the Emperor. The full delegation of powers to Crown Princes and Princes Imperial was there for emergencies. It has never been intended to mean that the Crown Prince or Prince Imperial fully exercises powers, without consulting the Emperor, when the Emperor is not on a leave of absence - then the region would have three emperors. Not one of the Crown Princes or Princes imperial during my tenure as Emperor ever interpreted the same delegation in that way. There was nothing urgent about firing the Mayor of Onderford or appointing the Chancellor of the University - these were both non-urgent matters with wider implications within the region and should have been left to the Emperor to decide. Unlike previous Crown Princes, you were not content to do that.[/quote]

Why didn't the job descriptions of the Crown Prince and Prince Imperial include "In case the Emperor is absent, your job is to relay messages to the Emperor for when he returns"? The argument about the delegated powers being only for emergencies is at best simply to distract from the fundamental issue; the Emperor's activity was deplorable and unacceptable, the region was stagnating from a lack of initiative, and you facilitated it. I do understand your hesitancy to remove your successor from the throne though; what is your legacy? Choosing Theoden the Inactive to succeed you?

[quote="Onderkelkia";p="39487234"]Since my move to a fuller form of retirement[/quote]

If you had even a small amount of shame you would stop insulting our intelligence by repeating this. One does wonder, does this game mean that much to you? How can one not be able to move on?

To put it plainly. When one retires, one [i]retires[/i]. Full stop. No ifs, no buts, no asterisks. Your retirement effectively never took place. And that brings me to my pet subject; why did I leave the LKE.

At some point, it was noticed that the API was not functioning; there was a problem with the code. Despite me repeatedly raising it and being assured it was being worked on, the problem kept dragging on. The Emperor was (as usual) inactive. A solution had to be found. And we (mainly Valfor, and supported by me) proposed a change of policy; using stamps. It went against our long-standing policy but as Prince Imperial I thought I was well within my rights to coordinate with the rest of the active (crucial point) of the Imperial House and effect a change of policy. 

It was at this point Onder protested. He vociferously protested against stamps but in what can only suppose was a favour he allowed us to go forward if we did not implement the badge we designed for those who chose to donate stamps. [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTalleyrand/General/main/Stamps_1.txt?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABTCVPMWEXWXIZN46P52GTMIYSFXJ3Q]I protested[/url] to this interference with my policy-setting prerogative by a retired member of the monarchy. It worths mentioning that I only wanted to have my objection recorded, and I wasn't considering resigning or anything. Onder's (very mature) answer was to remove my RO powers and [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTalleyrand/General/main/Stamps_2.txt?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABTCVPMX7LODUL2UKRPQW4PYYSFXNGA]again distract from the main issue.[/url] He even went so far as to compare my words with those of Mare Nostrum.

Condescension; sounds familiar? Enemies until proven friends. But, rest assured that you now have Nulkia and Arcadia, who are most definitely friends; in the sense that they never existed independently from your shadow.

To tie this all up because it has gotten long, [b]if you are someone capable for making your own, independent, and considered decisions the LKE is not the place for you and never will be.[/b]

[quote="Onderkelkia";p="39487234"]Having written and revised many documents for you to deliver over the years, I can also recognise the help that you have received in drafting your above post.[/quote]

Oh, and before you try this nonsense with me, I knew how to write long before I met you and you bet I will long after I have forgotten all about you.
