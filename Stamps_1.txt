I would like to formally register my objection to one's personal objections getting in the way of the executive leadership's running of the region. With all due respect, if you wanted to control the direction of the region you should have never abdicated.

I strongly object to my ability to work as a member of the Imperial House is limited by someone with no responsibility for the running of the region.
